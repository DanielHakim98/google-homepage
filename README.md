# Project: Google-Homepage

* Basically, This is my first project that I will mostly create by myself
with helf of Google search. 
* Before this, I could not build my own webpage and only follow youtube tutorial.
* This project that will be built is a "Google homepage" project. I'll 
deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.
* Once I finished building the homepage, I'll come back here to list down what
skills I used to complete the project and what new things I've learned. 
* This note also will be my self-reflection after finishing the project. Wish me
luck!

* I have learned and applied a lot new css property in order to build this website. Those are:
    * Margin, Border, Padding
    * Flexbox
    * Pseudo condition (Hover, Active etc.)
* It's important to understand those because those helped me to manage and arrange the location of navigation
bar, photo of google, search box, search button and footer.
