-Basically, This is my first project that I will mostly create by myself
with helf of Google search

-Before this, I could not build my own webpage and only follow youtube tutorial.

-This project that will be built is a "Google homepage" project. I'll 
deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.

-Once I finished building the homepage, I'll come back here to list down what
skills I used to complete the project and what new things I've learned. 

-This note also will be my self-reflection after finishing the project. Wish me
luck!
